# Installation and Setup
As and when, we find issues that users send us, we will be updating this section.

## Known Issues

1. Panamax script requires write permissions on the /Users/<username> folder
Panamax needs write access to the /Users/<username> folder otherwise the Panamax installer will fail. Panamax and Vagrant store its configuration in this folder at ~/.panamax and ~/.panamax/.vagrant, so it should be writable.
