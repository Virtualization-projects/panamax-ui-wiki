**Image Removal**

Images are the building blocks of Panamax templates.  The apps you create and launch will download images from multiple sources consuming disk space. Images no longer needed can be deleted from the Manage Images link from the Dashboard page.  Clicking the X to the right of the image name will delete the image from your system.  

The following images should never be deleted as they are core components of Panamax
  - centurylink/panamax-api:latest
  - centurylink/panamax-ui:latest
  - google/cadvisor:0.1.0


**Image Refresh**

If you need to reinstall an image delete it as described above and relaunch the template.
