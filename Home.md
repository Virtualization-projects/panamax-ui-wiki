[Panamax](http://panamax.io) is an open-source project that makes deploying complex containerized apps as easy as Drag-and-Drop.  The Panamax project source is currently comprised of several code repositories. 
* [Panamax-UI](https://github.com/CenturyLinkLabs/panamax-ui) 
* [Panamax-API](https://github.com/CenturyLinkLabs/panamax-api)
* [CTL Base UI kit](https://github.com/CenturyLinkLabs/ctl-base-ui)

**Please note:** Panamax is **not** [even near 1.0 yet](https://github.com/CenturyLinkLabs/panamax-ui/wiki/Release-Notes). It does function, but when it doesn’t we’d hope you report the bug or get involved actively developing it.  We think there are many possibilities to further enhance and extend the tool and welcome your feedback and help.
